//
// Note: If the user have manually set the time on their 
// device to the future or past this script will behave 
// differently on their device.

// month (required)
// day (optional)

// seconds = (optional)

// The time should be in UTC. UTC is almost the same as GMT.
// UTC was a new universal standard created to adapt to earths 
// varying rotation (Leap seconds). The difference between UTC 
// and GMT is minimal. So Paris is GMT+1 then subtract 1 hour to 
// the time when setting the time
